title: Space Shooter Using Unity 3D
fullview: true
---

Wanting to create a game for a while now, I never knew where to start. Finally I decided to just take some tutorials and work through them.

I followed a tutorial for creating a [Space Shooter with Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/space-shooter) and this is what I came up with. Nothing unique or exciting, just getting to know the application and a little more about game programming/design. All assets used in this game was provided by [Unity 3D](http://unity3d.com/).

Hopefully this isnâ€™t the last game that will be posted. Enjoy...

    var u = new UnityObject2();
    u.initPlugin(document.getElementById("unityPlayer"), "http://arcturial.github.io/downloads/Space_Shooter.unity3d");
